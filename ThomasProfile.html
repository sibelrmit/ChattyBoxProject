							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>My name is Thomas Pham and I am currently studying a Bachelors of IT at RMIT. I am also working in a group called “Chatty Box” for my assignment 2 in the intro to IT course. My parents are from Vietnam however I was born in Australia. Some hobbies I have are playing video games such as Osu, League of Legends and volarant and watching anime. My current favourite anime are Darling in the Franxx, Re:Zero and Fate/stay night. My current interests in IT are in the VR/AR and AI industries. I don’t really have much experience in IT currently but hope to gain more in my course.</p>
							<h2>Personality Tests</h2>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic15.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The tests above show some traits of what I am such as being a logical thinker and methodical. However, I do not think that this changes my behavior when I work in a team because I believe I am able to adapt to how other people work to make it easier for them. I believe that the results of the Myer-Briggs test could be beneficial when forming a team because having people who work in similar ways on a team could result in higher productivity.</p>
							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<p>My ideal job is developing AR/VR Tools engineering at oculus because I have always been intrigued by the idea of being able to immerse myself in another world via virtual reality. Shows like Sword art online have also made me wonder how far the technology can go. The skills required are: </p>
							<p>- Bachelors of Computer science, maths or related field</p>
							<p>- 3+ years experience with C/C++ programming and developing application</p>
							<p>- OpenGL, DirectX or Vulkan experience</p>
							<p>- 3+ years experience scripting in Java, C, or python</p>
							<p>- Creating developing topoling</p>
							<p>- Low level debugging or profiling</p>
							<p>- Developing, maintaining and extending build systems</p>
							<p>- Android development, especially in graphics and performance</p>
							<p>- Experience with CPU and GPU optimization</p>
							<p>- VR experience</p>
							<p>  </p>
