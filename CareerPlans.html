							<h1>ChattyBox Teams Career Plans</h1>
							<h2>Sibel Jasar</h2>
							<p>My initial ideal job was to be a Senior Consultant in Data Platforms and Advanced Analytics, however while being in university and viewing the Burning Glass data, I have learnt that I really enjoy coding and software engineering. So I have since expanded my ideal job to something software engineering and coding based rather than a job concerned with databases, SQL and analytical data. My first step in my career plan is getting a regular, minimum wage job to get out into the workforce and interacting with customers, working with business goals and working with others in an environment. Another first step is successfully completing my university degree and getting my Bachelor in IT, which is a certificate needed for any job I am interested in applying for. After graduating, I aim to apply for graduate programs at various companies and businesses because they train you up a lot for multiple roles across the company and you start at a higher level.</p>
							<p>Additionally, oftentimes (if you have made a good impression) the company hires you full time after the graduate program is finished because you have worked with them for such a period of time. However, graduate programs are hard to get into and there is a lot of competition for them. If I do not get into a graduate program, my plan is to analyse the best companies and types of IT roles that are popular at that time into the future and at my interest. Then I would apply for those that interest me and are with reputable companies. Once I have the job I like, I aim to work there for a couple years and plan my next move in the ladder of success, and seek out a side move or promotion because the working world of IT is so broad and interesting and I would like to gain experience in the different aspects of IT.</p>
							<h2>Thomas Pham</h2>

							<h2>Kerry Lam</h2>
							<p>Over the course of this semester, my interest in the area of data science has not changed. However, my understanding of what is involved in a career within data science has seen some slight revisions, and subsequently provided me with more informed interests in the field. While a role as a data scientist is still of interest to me, I now understand that I’d be quite willing to take on various other roles involved with the handling and manipulation of Big Data. A job as a data analyst would not be too far removed from the tasks of a data scientist, but I do recognise that I also wouldn’t be opposed to a slight shift in paradigms by taking on the job of a data visualist.</p>
							<p>For me, the most straightforward approach from my current position is to continue my Bachelors in Information Technology and proceed through the data management stream from my second year. An alternative route would be to completely switch paths and undertake a Bachelors in Data Science, which may offer me a more focused and direct route. However, I currently believe that continuing with my current course is a satisfactory means to attaining my long term goals and offers a wider variety of skills, which I would much prefer over being an expert in one specific area.</p>
							<p>During my time as a student, I would hope to attain some work experience directly related to working with big data, most likely through internships and other similar opportunities. After completing my postgraduate, I would aim to progress my career by targeting medium sized companies in my job applications, as they would have a reasonable demand for people who can work with data, while not being overwhelming in the way that a major company might be. Eventually, after no more than a decade of experience, I might aim to move to companies that have a national influence.</p>
							<h2>Phannavy Plean</h2>
							<p>My ideal job has slightly changed from before, as I have found a more appropriate role that aligns with my career goals and passions which helps further build on my current existing skills. Instead of the vague role of being the Director of Technology, I have set my sights on moving up to a Chief Creative Officer by first achieving a position as a Creative Director/Designer preferably within the game industry, but not limited to that. The career plan I have drafted for myself entails successful completion of a Bachelor’s Degree to gain the relevant skills needed for foundations of this role, then throughout the years to build on my current existing design skills to refine and specialise as a designer/artist. Picking up the Japanese language again to advance to N2 proficiency level is also an additional work in progress for future job opportunities. Ideally, I would like to obtain an entry-level position job in the IT industry to gain the relevant work experience required for a creative officer, then work my way up, whilst networking via my gaming hobbies to connect with the gaming industry in the meantime.</p>

							<h2>Aliyah Gino</h2>
							<p>My ideal job would be either a Data Analyst or Software Developer. The skills required are Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, statistics, econometrics, physic or a related quantitative field; Strong proficiency in Python, SQL; Deep statistical skills such as utilized in A/B testing, analyzing observational data and modeling; Experience writing software in a professional environment; Experience building data visualisations; Experience with data science tools such as Pandas, Numpy, R, Matlab, octave; Experience in devops, i.e. Linux, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes. Therefore my first step in my career plan would be to graduate in Computer Science and hopefully during my studies I would like to apply for an internship where I can ideally experience being a Software Developer or Data Analyst. By the end of the course I would like to study Masters in Computer Science or Data Science while getting this master degree. I would work  in the workplace as a Graduate Software Developer to gain more experience. After graduating in the Masters degree and having more experience later in the future my plan is then to work towards my ideal job which is being a Senior Software Developer in a company.</p>

							<h2>Johnny Le</h2>
							<p>My ideal job initially was to be a Business Analyst however after looking at the Burning Glass Data from the previous assignment, I have also extended my options to also pursue a Data or Systems Analyst position. My career plan to be able to achieve this has been to first of all start off with any job to gain fundamental skills & experience in the workforce such as communication skills, dealing with pressure and working under time constraints which is essential to almost any position. With me working in many retail jobs as a high school student as well as during University, I can say that I have successfully achieved this part of the plan - developing communication, time management, negotiation and some management skills.</p>
							<p>After I had gained some work experience, my next step in my career plan would be to finish off University and graduate with a Bachelor’s Degree in Business majoring in Information Systems. One of the main career outcomes of this particular course is a Business Analyst which was why I have chosen to study it. After graduating, I will apply for a graduate program in any company as this would fasttrack my career and help me achieve my career goals much sooner. Given that graduate programs have very limited spaces and is a very competitive job market to be in, I do have a back-up plan which is to apply for entry level positions in an IT company and if that is also unsuccessful, I would instead work my way up in my current job and attempt to get hired in the IT department. Once I have achieved an entry level IT position, which I am guessing would be some sort of IT support or a help desk role, I would try to work my way up and specialise in a particular area. Then after that, I would network in my company and hopefully get a Junior Analyst position and work there for a few months to years before I gain the relevant experience to be able to achieve my career goal of being a Business/Data Analyst.</p>
							<p>With my current situation, I was accepted into a graduate program at a Telecommunications industry for 2021, so my plan is to be able to pursue the IT pathway in that graduate program and complete the 18 month work rotation. After that is completed, I would by then develop my network and relevant experience and skills to be able to pursue a Business/Data Analyst role. The timeframe I have given myself is 5 years to be able to achieve this career goal.</p>
