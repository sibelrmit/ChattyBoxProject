							<h1>Group Reflections</h1>
							<h2>Sibel Jasar</h2>
							<p>I believe the team worked much better together in this project in comparison to the last! We definitely communicated a lot more for this project! We had weekly meetings every week, without fail, and for group members that were unable to make it to meetings, we filled them in on new tasks and information. As a group, we got to demonstrate and use our creativity, which was seen with the mock ups and designs we made. It was really fun and cool designing the chatbot together and brainstorming ideas for the chatbots design.</p>
							<p>Although we were consistent with the meetings every week, we didn’t have the whole team present for them, but rather usually 3 to 4 members present at each meeting. The first meeting had every member present, but it fell off through project progression. Despite this though, we still improved in the fact that we actually had weekly meetings where we worked on the project together and this really aided the workload and communication for this project!</p>
							<h2>Thomas Pham</h2>
							<p>This group assignment I really felt that everyone in the group was growing more comfortable with each other. There was a lot more communication amongst the group members which led everyone to be consistently on the same page. We were able to have a meeting every week and the people who missed out on the meeting were filled in so they weren’t left behind. With the end of the semester coming a lot of deadlines were coming up for each group member which caused some tasks to be finished a day so later, however since we started the assignment earlier we were able to accommodate these late deadlines being met and still finish on time. I was very surprised at the amount of people who were willing to jump in to help other people with their tasks if they asked for it. I can’t really think of anything in specific that could be improved because I think that how my group handled the assignment was how an ideal group is supposed to work. One thing I learnt about groups was that to work well you have to keep an open mind to work well with others.</p>
							
							<h2>Kerry Lam</h2>
							<p>Because I joined the group when the assignment had already made a large amount of progress, I was unable to get heavily involved during the nascence of the project. However, I did not allow this to discourage me from attaining as thorough an understanding of my work as possible, and I made sure to keep my communications open with the team as much as I could in order to allow for me to contribute to the project as much as I could within my limited time as a part of the group.</p>
							<p> I was only part of the group for long enough to participate in the final two meetings. However, I made efforts to get myself on track before my first meeting with the group. Initially, I struggled slightly with communicating as I was unfamiliar with the platforms with which we were talking through. Eventually I was able to get on track and my efficiency as a team member vastly improved as a result. Overall, while I don’t think that my work was fully 100%, I am satisfied with what I was able to achieve considering my circumstances.</p>
							
							<h2>Phannavy Plean</h2>
							<p>This assignment really pushed our group to work harder in asserting more effort into collaboratively working as a group and increased our communication with each other. Everyone put in as much effort as they could based on the feedback we received from our previous assignment which caused more meetings to occur weekly. Trying to get everyone online together was something that we made small progress in but it was still a factor that could have been improved on, however it was not a detriment as we were able to efficiently inform every member of the project’s updates and required tasks to be focused on for the week. I was still surprised as to how accommodating our group was, the amount of help members offered to each other displayed how our teamwork has improved, as the workload was heavily increased. One thing I have learned about groups is not to set a strict amount of expectations on members as there are multiple factors (time constraints, other commitments, unexpected circumstances, etc) that can change and influence their progress of work, but as long as we communicated this to our group, plans to accommodate the completion of certain tasks to be done in time were organised efficiently.</p>
							<h2>Aliyah Gino</h2>
							<p>I think the group worked well together and better in this project. There were improvements in the group such as we had better communication, had weekly meetings though there were times during the weekly meetings there were people not there due to personal reasons. Despite all this everyone in the group is all still notified or kept up to date with all the things we need to be done. Everyone in the group did their individual task and even though some of us it was a bit delayed due to other commitments, we all still managed to complete each individual task.</p>
							<p>Another thing i realised is that if one group member is finished we tend to help out that group member. Overall I think the group did way better with this project with the communication, the work and the meetings.</p>
							<h2>Johnny Le</h2>
							<p>I think our team did a great job on working together to complete this project. Communication was clear and consistent throughout and we had our weekly meetings as scheduled. Everyone in our team had completed their assigned tasks without any issues. Although we did lose a team member, we were able to gain another team member as a replacement which luckily did not cause that much of a setback for us.</p>
							<p>One of the challenges we did face was attending the meetings. We sometimes did not have all members attend the weekly meetings however we were able to fill them in on what was discussed including having the meeting recorded so that they could watch it at a later time. The workload was much heavier than the previous assignment and with our nearing deadlines for other courses, it had been increasingly difficult to complete our tasks at the agreed time. We were slightly delayed in finishing our tasks but luckily we forecasted this and had set earlier deadlines to counteract this.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
							<p>As a group, we believed we performed much better in this assignment than our previous, even with the increasingly difficult tasks and challenges that came this time around. As we grew much more comfortable with each other and our communication improved, so did our quality of work. We did not hesitate to help each other when the tasks were a bit overwhelming. We were able to hold successful team meetings each and every week at the same time. We communicated much more often and more frequently this time. It was great to see the amount of teamwork and effort that each individual had put in and we could not be any prouder of what we have achieved as a group. </p>
							<p>As initially mentioned, we definitely encountered many more challenges for this assignment. Such challenges included working within the agreed timeframe. Due to the nearing end of semester and increase in pressure, stress and workload for this course as well as for other courses, we encountered some tasks requiring more time than our agreed date. However, due to us setting early deadlines, this gave us enough time to finish our tasks and make any necessary adjustments without rushing to complete the assignment. We also all proactively offered to help our team members who were struggling with their assigned tasks which was great to see. Another challenge we had was trying to get our prototype working. With our limited experience in coding and using software that did not have the available features that we needed, we were able to come up with alternative solutions as a team to counteract this.</p>
							<p>Although we did have weekly meetings, we weren’t able to get everyone to attend. However, this wasn’t a major issue for us as we had alternative methods to fill everyone in who missed out. We recorded the meetings, and messaged our team members on what was discussed including any tasks we have assigned to them.</p>
							<p>With the increased workload and challenges that we had faced this time, it had helped us learn how to overcome these challenges and grow not only individually but as well as in a team which turned out to be a great learning experience for each of us. Additionally, with the COVID-19 restrictions, it had also taught us how to adapt to a new environment since we were always used to working face-to-face in groups rather than a work from home setting.</p>
