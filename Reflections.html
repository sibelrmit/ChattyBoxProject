							<h2>Sibel Jasar</h2>
							<p>I believe the team worked much better together in this project in comparison to the last! We definitely communicated a lot more for this project! We had weekly meetings every week, without fail, and for group members that were unable to make it to meetings, we filled them in on new tasks and information. As a group, we got to demonstrate and use our creativity, which was seen with the mock ups and designs we made. It was really fun and cool designing the chatbot together and brainstorming ideas for the chatbots design.</p>
							<p>Although we were consistent with the meetings every week, we didnâ€™t have the whole team present for them, but rather usually 3 to 4 members present at each meeting. The first meeting had every member present, but it fell off through project progression. Despite this though, we still improved in the fact that we actually had weekly meetings where we worked on the project together and this really aided the workload and communication for this project!</p>

							<p>I think our team did a great job on working together to complete this project. Communication was clear and consistent throughout and we had our weekly meetings as scheduled. Everyone in our team had completed their assigned tasks without any issues. Although we did lose a team member, we were able to gain another team member as a replacement which luckily did not cause that much of a setback for us.</p>
							<p>One of the challenges we did face was attending the meetings. We sometimes did not have all members attend the weekly meetings however we were able to fill them in on what was discussed including having the meeting recorded so that they could watch it at a later time. The workload was much heavier than the previous assignment and with our nearing deadlines for other courses, it had been increasingly difficult to complete our tasks at the agreed time. We were slightly delayed in finishing our tasks but luckily we forecasted this and had set earlier deadlines to counteract this.</p>
