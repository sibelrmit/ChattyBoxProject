								<h2>Group Processes</h2>
								<p>As a group, we believed we did a good job working together to complete our previous assignment. We all communicated with each other effectively to ensure that we were on top of things. The process of allocating tasks to members from the start of the project worked really well in the previous assignment and is a process we will continue to implement for this assignment. Having individual tasks allocated to different group members ensured that tasks were done efficiently, so that each member could start on their work and complete it simultaneously.</p>
								<p>The biggest challenge we faced as a team during the first project was having regular team meetings. Some meetings could not be attended by team members due to conflicting schedules that were unavoidable such as work commitments and other classes. This is a change that will be implemented into this project. As a team we have introduced a set-in-stone allocated time and day for meetings that cannot be changed, and we are ensuring that members keep that time slot open for team meetings.</p>
								<p>Another work process that worked well for our team, and is going to be continued into this project, was having a shared google doc which held all our work. It was continuously updated and kept members informed on what parts were being worked on, needed to be worked on, revised or edited and what work progress was being made.</p>
